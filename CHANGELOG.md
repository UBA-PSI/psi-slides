# Changelog

Notable changes per release. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), with the caveat that
while the major version is `0` the source format itself may still change.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [0.1.0]

First public release. psi-slides has carried a full semester of university
teaching; everything below is in use rather than aspirational.

### The medium

- One Markdown `source.md` per lecture builds **four self-contained HTML views**:
  `audience.html` (the projection), `speaker.html` (the presenter cockpit),
  `print.html` (a reading document with cover and table of contents), and
  `print-notes.html` (the same document with `> note:` blocks folded in).
- Everything is inlined: CSS, JavaScript, images, Shiki-highlighted code,
  KaTeX-rendered maths, and – when the author supplies them – webfonts.
  Nothing is fetched at run time; the files open from `file://`.
- **Collapse**: the same prose is rendered at two densities. The projection
  shows the topic sentence plus promoted `**bold**` fragments; the document
  shows all of it. `::: slide` and `::: script` are the escape hatch when no
  first-sentence rule can carve the argument up sensibly.

### Authoring

- Chunk grammar `## tag: Heading | Sub-heading {.width #id}` with eight tags
  and four widths.
- Body directives: reveal segments (`---`), `::: expand`, `::: margin`,
  `::: marginalia`, `::: cols`, `::: side` / `::: flip`, `::: slide`,
  `::: script`, `::: embed`.
- `![](fig-id)` resolves against `assets/`; SVG is spliced inline so it
  re-colours with the theme.
- Maths as `$inline$` and `$$display$$`, rendered at build time. Only the
  font families a lecture's formulas actually use are embedded.
- Video: a clip is a figure that moves. Inlined under a per-file cap, staged
  into `videos/` above it, or played from a URL.
- Hosted players via `::: embed <url>` for YouTube and Vimeo, loaded only
  while their chunk is on screen.
- Frontmatter can pin how a lecture opens: `font`, `theme`, `collapse`,
  `auto-fit`, `slide-numbers`, `lang`, and a `fonts:` block.

### Presenting

- Audience and speaker windows sync over `window.postMessage`, which works
  across `file://` origins where `BroadcastChannel` does not.
- Cockpit: column scrubber, stage mirror, editable notes, preview strip,
  timer, laser pointer, and a preview of the segment you are about to reveal.
- `V` freezes the projection so the room holds its slide while you read
  ahead; thawing catches it up. `B` blanks the projection only.
- Overview board, full-text search from anywhere, table of contents,
  per-collapse-mode zoom and auto-fit.
- Live annotations typed during a talk, exportable back into `source.md`.

### Tooling

- `lint.js`, zero-dependency, enforcing the parsing contract and per-tag word
  budgets.
- `--watch` for live reload, `--serve` for a loopback HTTP server,
  `--optimize-images`, `--integrate-annotations`, `--new`.
- A skill at `.claude/skills/psi-slides-authoring/` for writing lectures with
  an LLM assistant.

### Known limits

Read [When *not* to use this](README.md#when-not-to-use-this) and
[the comparison](docs/comparison.md) before committing a semester to it.
There is no test suite, one author, and the format is still moving.
